# Admin Dashboard

I've made this project during my JavaScript Full-Stack curriculum from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard">The Odin Project</a>.

I changed the original project for a cryptocurrencies admin dashboard.

What I've learned :

- More advanced CSS with Grid, and using Flexbox along
- Added a sidebar menu that unfolds on hover
- Using basic transitions and animations with CSS
